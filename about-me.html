            The year following my high school graduation I attended Western
            Washington University for one school year and then decided to study
            at Shoreline Community College and to come back home because my band
            was becoming quite popular in the local music scene. At Shoreline I
            studied Digital Audio Engineering and at that time had some
            misperseptions about the role of college in ones life. I thought
            simply attending the college would prepare me with the skills and
            opportunities for landing a job in a recording studio or audio
            house, and there I could record and make music for a living.
            Although I did have sufficient audio experience and and developed
            skills for audio recording, songwriting, and critical listening
            learned from my involvement with with bands since I was 12 years
            old, I didn't realize that employers were looking for a professional
            work portfolio that demonstrated my ability to work alongside their
            team, and in order to actually get hired, I would need to work on
            building a professional portfolio by working on projects outside of
            school. I do still love playing and making music, but prefer doing
            so more as a personal endevor rather than a career.

            After graduating from Shoreline Community College, I worked as an AV
            Technician in Seattle, WA for almost two years, and I enjoyed the
            position's responsibilites and the places I was able to see while
            working. Often times I would work in large teams setting up stages
            with video projections and confrence audio systems for workshop
            events and seminars in Seattle and Portland, but more often I would
            be working independently, travelling all over Washington State
            setting up small audio-video systems for telecomunication
            presentations at different restaurants, medical clinics,
            dentistries, hotels, downtown offices, and anywhere professional
            video confrence calls can be made. It was truly fun to go so many
            places and meet so many new faces, and to make sure their audio and
            video runs smooth like clockwork during their presentations. This
            built up my ability to communicate professionally with clients about
            their uses for the audio and often times finding solutions when
            there were problems present, all while managing the technical
            aspects of operating the audio and video equiptment.
