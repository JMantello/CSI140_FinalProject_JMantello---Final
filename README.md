# CSI140 Final Project - Web Portfolio

This was our web portfolio project for CSI140 Front-End Web Development in Spring of 2021. If I were to do it differently now, 
I would focus on using less containers, classes, and id's, and try to focus on the readability of my code, and I think with this project
I accidently went too far with those.
