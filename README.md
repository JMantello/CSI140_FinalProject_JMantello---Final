# Front-End Web Development Final Project - Web Portfolio

This was my final for my Front-End Web Development class in Spring of 2021. Looking back at this project, I think I accidently used too many containers, classes, 
and id's. I am now making another web portfolio and I am focusing on keeping my code simple, and only making complexity when necessary to add desired features.
